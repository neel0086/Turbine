# Turbine(AdvanceIde)

# Project Description: 
An Ide suitable for competitve programmers in which we are trying to bring all automation tools and visualizer in an ide which existing players dont consist of.

# Higher Level Functionality
 <h2>Tree Visualiser</h2>
Once the user start giving input accordingly tree will be drawn on the users screen, presently in version 1.0 we have implemented code for the following input scheme<br>
      <h4>a) Seliased level order traversal<br></h4>
      <h4>b) Edge list</h4>
&nbsp; <h2>Function Automation</h2>
Once the user start typing its code and if similiar function is leading to some function which user has wrote in its other previous codes of any timestamp our ide will suggest user with the function name and the body of it <br>
&nbsp; <h2>Enabling code suggestion for online coding platforms</h2>
In version 1.0 we include the most famous coding platform leetcode, has leetcode doesn't consists of any intellisense, and copy pasting codes and running testing on vs code is quite time-consuming, so we provide a feature where users could just paste question name and would able to acess whole question, input, etc and could easily use our intellisense(which is provided by extensions)

# electron-quick-start

**Clone and run for a quick way to see IDE in action.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components in depth within the [Tutorial](https://electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-prerequisites).
